# **Work with Git**

## What is the Git?

* Keeps and uses information
* Helps to control information
* Stores multiple versions of the same file
* Helps to avoid confusion about file versions when editing multiple times
* ~~Buy It!~~ FREE for all

## Let's try to use It possible

When using program Git, you will need to learn a few command codes
* ***git init*** - initializing the local repository
* ***git status*** - report status, soldier!
* ***git add*** - add file or files to next commit
* ***git commit -m "message"*** - create commit
* ***git log*** - history of your work
* ***git checkout*** - transmit to another commit
* ***git checkout master*** - back to main branch
* ***git diff*** - see all yours mistakes
* ***branch*** - will see branches
* ***branch branch name*** - create and name branch 
* ***git checkout*** - jumping like squirrel from branch to branch
* ***git branch -d branch name*** delete branch 

## If you suddenly use Markdown

Learn the syntax, bro!

* (#) or (=)  - # First level header
* (##) or (-) - ## Point ahead
* (**) or (__) - __BOLD__
* (*) or (_) - *Italics*
* (~~) - ~~Cross out~~
* (***) - ***BOLD Italics***
