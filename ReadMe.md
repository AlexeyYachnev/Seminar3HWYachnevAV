When using program Git, you will need to learn a few command codes
* ***git init*** - initializing the local repository
* ***git status*** - report status, soldier!
* ***git add*** - add file or files to next commit
* ***git commit -m "message"*** - create commit
* ***git log*** - history of your work
* ***git checkout*** - transmit to another commit
* ***git checkout master*** - back to main branch
* ***git diff*** - see all yours mistakes
* ***branch*** - will see branches
* ***branch branch name*** - create and name branch 
* ***git checkout*** - jumping like squirrel from branch to branch
* ***git branch -d branch name*** delete branch
